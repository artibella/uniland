                      Content type is an important variable in licensing fees
                      and can ultimately have one of the biggest impacts on your
                      running costs.A content type in the headless CMS
                      represents a piece of content you want to write. Teams
                      generally begin by creating one content type per
                      presentation component, e.g. there is a hero content type
                      for the hero, and a call to action (CTA) content type for
                      the CTA.For teams just beginning with a headless CMS, it
                      can be difficult to know how many content types will be
                      needed. An educated guess will be made; however, the added
                      cost incurred if the underestimate is significant can be
                      as much as 2x the cost of the CMS–a lesson learned far too
                      late.In addition, mapping content types to presentation
                      components–a practice recommended by headless CMS
                      vendors–can be a dangerous path, as you are essentially
                      locking content into individual components in a single
                      channel and specific content structure. This makes it
                      difficult to reuse content outside of that specific
                      component (e.g. it is for the website only, not
                      omnichannel by default).If you manage design decisions
                      inside of your CMS–for example, component display variants
                      where a user can select multiple variations of a design’s
                      content–each option is essentially a content type. Another
                      culprit impacting your volume of content types.Sometimes
                      teams are forced to use content types in unpredictable
                      ways in order to create a usable system for content
                      authors. Circumstances where a need that initially
                      appeared to be handled by one content type, may ultimately
                      require multiple.These situations artificially increase
                      the number of content types used and become around 70-80%
                      of

Combined with the types you need to represent the content you originally planned, and your license is now approaching a custom tier.You can reduce the number of content types significantly and avoid overages by structuring them for broader use: creating types to represent presentation-free semantic content (like Recipes, Events, Product Information), and using this preplanned structure to better predict volume prior to contracting.In terms of the tech stack as a whole, another best practice for minimizing content types is to channel all design decisions through the platform that manages your digital experience, such as '

                    text: ". Vendors have different names for projects, such as spaces, stacks, and datasets.Vendor contracts begin with a specific number of projects and each project has a set amount of content types. For example, a website can consist of one or more projects depending on how it is structured. Projects are added as the website grows, often done in an effort to reduce overall complexity. Each additional project adds another set of content types, allowing architects to better organize the website across multiple projects (e.g. by channel, by device, by sections of the website).\_The danger occurs as the digital entity you are supporting evolves over time, and you find your structure has expanded to more projects than originally contracted, forcing the license toward a more expensive tier than budgeted for.\_Adding projects can keep the number of content types per project low, thus managing content type-related costs; however, you are still paying for multiple projects. Conversely, packing more into a project forces tough choices between content type overages and user complexity.The balance lies in strategic planning. For instance, instead of separating channels by project, you could combine channels into a single project using technology like "

                      Without an upfront strategy for structural organization,
                      or to reduce ongoing reliance on development resources,
                      brands can find their CMS costs soaring as they attempt to
                      scale a structure that was inadvertently fashioned to
                      expand license fees and development costs alongside.
                      Addressing business needs while planning an organizational
                      structure that avoids these pitfalls is key to avoiding
                      painful surprises year over year.

                      Content type is an important variable in licensing fees
                      and can ultimately have one of the biggest impacts on your
                      running costs.A content type in the headless CMS
                      represents a piece of content you want to write. Teams
                      generally begin by creating one content type per
                      presentation component, e.g. there is a hero content type
                      for the hero, and a call to action (CTA) content type for
                      the CTA.For teams just beginning with a headless CMS, it
                      can be difficult to know how many content types will be
                      needed. An educated guess will be made; however, the added
                      cost incurred if the underestimate is significant can be
                      as much as 2x the cost of the CMS–a lesson learned far too
                      late.In addition, mapping content types to presentation
                      components–a practice recommended by headless CMS
                      vendors–can be a dangerous path, as you are essentially
                      locking content into individual components in a single
                      channel and specific content structure. This makes it
                      difficult to reuse content outside of that specific
                      component (e.g. it is for the website only, not
                      omnichannel by default).If you manage design decisions
                      inside of your CMS–for example, component display variants
                      where a user can select multiple variations of a design’s
                      content–each option is essentially a content type. Another
                      culprit impacting your volume of content types.Sometimes
                      teams are forced to use content types in unpredictable
                      ways in order to create a usable system for content
                      authors. Circumstances where a need that initially
                      appeared to be handled by one content type, may ultimately
                      require multiple.These situations artificially increase
                      the number of content types used and become around 70-80%
                      of

Combined with the types you need to represent the content you originally planned, and your license is now approaching a custom tier.You can reduce the number of content types significantly and avoid overages by structuring them for broader use: creating types to represent presentation-free semantic content (like Recipes, Events, Product Information), and using this preplanned structure to better predict volume prior to contracting.In terms of the tech stack as a whole, another best practice for minimizing content types is to channel all design decisions through the platform that manages your digital experience, such as '

                    text: ". Vendors have different names for projects, such as spaces, stacks, and datasets.Vendor contracts begin with a specific number of projects and each project has a set amount of content types. For example, a website can consist of one or more projects depending on how it is structured. Projects are added as the website grows, often done in an effort to reduce overall complexity. Each additional project adds another set of content types, allowing architects to better organize the website across multiple projects (e.g. by channel, by device, by sections of the website).\_The danger occurs as the digital entity you are supporting evolves over time, and you find your structure has expanded to more projects than originally contracted, forcing the license toward a more expensive tier than budgeted for.\_Adding projects can keep the number of content types per project low, thus managing content type-related costs; however, you are still paying for multiple projects. Conversely, packing more into a project forces tough choices between content type overages and user complexity.The balance lies in strategic planning. For instance, instead of separating channels by project, you could combine channels into a single project using technology like "

                      Without an upfront strategy for structural organization,
                      or to reduce ongoing reliance on development resources,
                      brands can find their CMS costs soaring as they attempt to
                      scale a structure that was inadvertently fashioned to
                      expand license fees and development costs alongside.
                      Addressing business needs while planning an organizational
                      structure that avoids these pitfalls is key to avoiding
                      painful surprises year over year.
