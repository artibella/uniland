                      establish unique identifiers like metadata, taxonomy, and
                      tags, which render assets findable pronto through your DAM

                      Most DAM platforms can integrate by sharing links,
                      proffering out-of-the-box merges, and using APIs. See that
                      your DAM software offers multiple ways to connect to
                      external tools—or, at the very least, an extensive library
                      of integration partners. In the case of APIs, verify that
                      they are extensible ones that can evolve along with your
                      business.

                      Harnessing DAM’s advantages starts with setting up an
                      architecture that mirrors your website infrastructure.
                      That way, internal stakeholders who need file access can
                      readily come to grips with what they’re looking at and how
                      it fits into the overall content. That instant sense of
                      control and comfort on the part of the teams is priceless.
