                    What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make
                    pizza, of course!

                    Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we
                    exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn
                    out to be a brilliant idea as my father had just received a
                    baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza.

                    I told him if he helped me make it I would talk about him on
                    my website and he would be famous. That seemed to get his
                    attention. He thought the dough was "slimy and gross" but he
                    loved picking his own toppings, and the finished product was
                    "awesome".

                    You don’t have to let your pizza dough rise overnight – or
                    up to 48 hours – in the refrigerator, but if you do, it will
                    develop more flavor and air bubbles that will puff up when
                    the pizza is cooked. (Some people fight over the slices with
                    air bubbles.) Make sure to take the dough out of the
                    refrigerator an hour before using it to bring it to room
                    temperature.

                    There are some toppings that should be cooked first before
                    topping a pizza because they won’t cook fully before the
                    pizza is done cooking. Raw meat should be fully cooked
                    before adding it as a topping. Any vegetables that you don’t
                    want to be raw on the cooked pizza such as onions, peppers,
                    broccoli, or mushrooms should be sautéed first.

                    After the pizza dough has risen, you can freeze it to use
                    later. Divide the dough in half (or the portion sizes you
                    will be using to make your pizzas). Place on parchment paper
                    or a lightly floured dish and place, uncovered, in the
                    freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the freezer and
                    place in individual freezer bags, removing as much air as
                    you can from the bags. Return to the freezer and store for
                    up to 3 months.
