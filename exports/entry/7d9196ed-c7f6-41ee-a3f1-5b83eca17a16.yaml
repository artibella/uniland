                    Good thing, too, because lemon bars aren't snuggled down
                    under a fluffy blanket of meringue, so they need a lot of
                    sugar to balance their sour filling. That makes them sweeter
                    than pie, and a little more custardy, though not to the
                    extent of a yolky curd; unlike the French tarts next door,
                    lemon bars aren't so rich.

                    Maybe that's why so many culinary architects err on the side
                    of pragmatism, building lemon bars from whole eggs alone.
                    It's a nice thought, but it's a softer foundation that's
                    inclined to slowly ooze past the property line, so to speak,
                    making for a messy snack. Some combat that problem with a
                    thinner (some might say stingy) layer of filling, while
                    others forge ahead and bake their bars as thoroughly as any
                    cake, turning the custard all lumpy and weird. Then there
                    are those who resort to a spoonful of cornstarch, accepting
                    a murky custard as the price of stability.

                    But the lemon bars of my childhood were of a different sort,
                    thick slabs as yellow as a daffodil and clear like a spring
                    afternoon—no cloudy cornstarch in sight! I'm not sure what
                    church lady I should credit for impressing me so, but that's
                    the image that always comes to mind. With a great deal of
                    trial and error, I've found that the trick to thick lemon
                    bars without cornstarch is making the custard from equal
                    parts whole eggs and yolks, by weight. That ratio offers
                    enough extra yolks for structure, without turning the
                    custard into an ultra-dense curd.

                    By nature, the dough is better suited to a food processor,
                    which can tear through cold butter to coat the flour in fat
                    (thus shortening the potential length of each gluten
                    strand). Since it all comes together lightning-fast, the
                    butter stays cold, making for a dry meal that's more Dippin'
                    Dots than dough, easily sprinkled and smooshed into a
                    parchment-lined anodized-aluminum pan.

                    dimensions tend to make the bars too thin. Metal cake pans
                    cool far more rapidly, but few folks own a set of stainless
                    steel pans, and that's where anodized aluminum comes in.

                  text: "It may not be a term you're actively aware of, but anodization is what makes iPad minis look so boss, and why certain lightweight cake pans never rust. Anodization is a manufacturing process that sends an electrical charge through a sheet of metal while it soaks in an acidic bath of electrolytes. The result of this, shall we say, shock therapy is a metal so chill, it won't even react when confronted by acidic liquids looking for a fight. Without anodization, citric acid + unfinished aluminum = janky, old-tin-can-flavored lemon bars.\_"

                    With the crust in the right pan and baking to a golden
                    brown, I prepare the filling on the stove. Again, it's
                    vitally important that everything from the pot to the whisk
                    be nonreactive (in those cases, that typically means
                    stainless steel), but it's otherwise dead easy to prepare.
                    Just combine the eggs and yolks, add the lemon zest and
                    sugar, then whisk until smooth.

                    Yeah, that's right, straight in the pan—no tempering
                    required! Ladling hot liquids while whisking with one hand
                    is like having to rub your head and pat your tummy—annoying
                    at best. Doubly so, considering the extra dishes. Tempering
                    is reasonable when dealing with eggs and hot liquids, which
                    are inherent to any infusion (like vanilla steeped in milk).
                    But, when combining eggs with room-temperature ingredients,
                    like fresh lemon juice, there really isn't any need so long
                    as everything is warmed up slowly over low heat.

                    Once you've knocked off the chill, you can turn up the dial
                    and let a digital thermometer be your guide. While egg yolks
                    and whites normally coagulate at around 140 and 150°F (60
                    and 66°C), respectively, sugar delays that process by about
                    10 degrees. To get a custard that's thick enough to slice,
                    it needs to go a little higher still, to about 170°F (77°C).

                    Cooking on the stovetop allows for precise control over the
                    custard's final texture, which is vastly preferable to
                    jiggling a hot pan in the oven and wondering exactly how
                    wobbly "wobbly" should be (or else trying to test the
                    relatively shallow filling layer with a Thermapen and hoping
                    you don't hit the crust).

                    Once cooled to room temperature, the lemon bars are chilled
                    and transferred to a cutting board (hence the aforementioned
                    parchment to pull them loose). You might be tempted to file
                    that under "fussy, cheffy steps I don't care about," but
                    wait! Cutting the bars in the pan will a) dull your knife
                    and b) scratch your pan, c) making future cakes or crusts
                    more likely to stick and d) ruining the anodized surface,
                    which e) negates its nonreactive properties, meaning, oh, f)
                    your future lemon bars will taste like a dirty penny.

                    Besides, with a cutting board, you'll be able to slice 'n'
                    dice the bars into the most gorgeously geometric squares.
                    Pack them up for picnics and potlucks (the high-sugar,
                    high-acid bars will do fine at room temperature), or serve
                    them straight from the fridge, cold and refreshing like

                    Like any self-respecting American, I finish my lemon bars
                    with a dusting of powdered sugar. It may not add much beyond
                    a hint of sweet against the sour filling, but it's hard to
                    overstate the visual appeal—a field of flawless white to
                    make edges look more crisp and the custard more radiant.

                    If powdered sugar isn't usually your cup of tea, you may
                    appreciate the mellower sweetness of organic brands; just be
                    aware that the organic sugar will begin to melt within 15
                    minutes. Conventional brands taste a little chalkier, but
                    they'll widen that window to about a half hour.
