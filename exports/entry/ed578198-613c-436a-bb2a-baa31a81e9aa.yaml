                      If your developers or agency propose custom coding your
                      BFF (backend for frontend), beware. Writing code for a BFF
                      might work for a small website supported by one headless
                      system; however, if you have five, 10, or even 20
                      connection points, your MACH project can soon spiral into
                      a complicated scenario:

                      MACH technologies, front-end components, and data sources

Yet, this still drops you into a glue code cycle that requires developers to manually connect enterprise data to your front-end framework.\_As your stack evolves and you integrate more MACH technologies, a GraphQL approach becomes untenable. With no visual workspace to handle presentation for marketing or relieve development from endless coding tasks, digital teams are disempowered and MACH projects are derailed.\_With the visual workspace, you don’t have to worry about extensive code. A front-end experience solution manages your connections for you and gives digital teams creator-centric tools to deliver experiences for any channel."
