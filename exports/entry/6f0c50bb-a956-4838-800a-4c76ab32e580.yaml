                      A major benefit of DAM is its ability to organize brand
                      assets in a central location. However, you and your team
                      must start and maintain the process in a simple,
                      easy-to-use architecture.A best practice along those lines
                      is to consult your subject-matter experts (SMEs)—teams
                      closest to your assets–generally your web and

                      Detailed version control cuts costs, streamlines
                      production workflows, and affords greater control over
                      digital assets.As your team edits and enhances assets over
                      time, multiple versions of the same file will result. Be
                      sure to either develop a naming convention to keep asset
                      versioning in order or pick a DAM solution that does that
                      for you. Some DAM solutions automatically organize
                      multiple versions of the same file, positioning the most
                      current one at the forefront for convenient access.

                      Most DAM platforms offer permission controls with which
                      system administrators can grant file access to only those
                      who need it. A way to do that is by adding names to a
                      group of authorized users or by sending those people a
                      link. Alternatively, establish a role within the system so
                      that only those who’ve been assigned that role can access
                      a specific set of files.Another good practice is the
                      “least privilege” access-control approach, i.e., give
                      people access to only the files they need. If those
                      stakeholders undertake new projects or switch roles, grant
                      them access to the appropriate assets.

                      As your business grows, your DAM needs might change.
                      Hence, think of your DAM platform as a living system and
                      continually evaluate its architecture and processes to
                      determine if they still serve your purpose.Through regular
                      evaluations, you can also optimize the experience for
                      end-users. They can flag the problems they face while on
