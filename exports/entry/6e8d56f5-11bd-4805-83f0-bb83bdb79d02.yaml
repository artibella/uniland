                    If you've never heard of a fruit sauce for pasta before,
                    this may strike you as a strange idea. To me, it's one of
                    the best winter pasta dishes, though it can work at any time
                    of year, since lemons, which peak in the coldest months, are
                    available year-round. It's quick and easy, coming together
                    with just a handful of ingredients, mostly pantry staples.
                    And it strikes a perfect balance between stomach-warming
                    richness, with all the cheese and butter, and a bright,
                    sunny blast of lemon. It's like sunlight shining on snow.

                    Recipes vary a bit. Some use only zest for the lemon
                    component; others incorporate some juice as well. Some add
                    cream to the mixture; others build the sauce with just
                    butter and cheese. I tested all these variables, even though
                    my colleagues and I were pretty confident that the cream
                    version would win out. We were wrong.

Back when I was working on my\_classic Roman fettuccine Alfredo recipe, I ran the same test, comparing a more traditional, no-cream recipe to the cream-spiked kind that's more common with American versions. Side by side, there was no contest: The cream may sound like a good idea, but it does nothing but cover up the lemony flavor of the more pared-down sauce.

                    And so it is with spaghetti al limone. All my tasters and I
                    expected to like the lemony cream sauce more, but we changed
                    our minds as soon as we sampled the cream-free version, the
                    lemon cutting through it with high-pitched clarity.

                    Making pasta al limone boils down to a few key details, all
                    of them identical to my recommendations for the Roman
                    Alfredo sauce. Start by melting butter in a skillet, adding
                    grated lemon zest and minced garlic to infuse it with
                    flavor. Then cook the pasta in a medium pot of boiling
                    salted water. (Contrary to the most common advice, less
                    water is better, as it becomes starchier than a large amount
                    of water would.) You can use dried pasta, but a satiny
                    butter sauce like this pairs better with fresh noodles. When
                    it's done, reserve some of the starchy pasta water, then
                    drain the pasta and add it to the melted butter.

                    Next, toss in grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese to thicken
                    and enrich the sauce. If it gets too dry and tight, just
                    loosen it with a little more of the reserved pasta water. As
                    a finishing touch, add as much fresh lemon juice as you
                    likeâ€”this is strictly a matter of personal preference. A
                    smaller dose will add a subtle tart counterpoint to all the
                    richness, while allowing the aromatic oils from the lemon
                    zest to remain prominent. More juice will punch up that
                    brightness and also steal some of the spotlight from the
                    zest. There's no right or wrong answer there, just slightly
                    different children from the same mother sauce.
