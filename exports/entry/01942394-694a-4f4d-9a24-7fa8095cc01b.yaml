                    Amatriciana meets carbonara, with a sausage cameo. That's
                    the best way to describe rigatoni alla zozzona, the "dirty"
                    Roman pasta collab you should get acquainted with. With
                    crisp guanciale, juicy sausage, onion, and tomato simmered
                    in rendered pork fat, this dish dials up the decadence,
                    which is saying something for a cuisine that's not exactly
                    known for light fare. Tossed with al dente rigatoni, it all
                    gets a glossy glow-up with an off-heat addition of egg yolks
                    and Pecorino Romano. If you ever need proof that Italian
                    cooking isn't always about subtlety and restraint, pasta all
                    zozzona is the ultimate receipt.

                    ). Unlike those dishes, you won't find zozzona on the menu
                    in every trattoria in the center of the capital, where less
                    popular but equally fantastic pastas like rigatoni con la
                    pajata (a tomato-based sauce featuring tender, milky
                    intestines from un-weaned calves) are more likely to make an
                    appearance, highlighting the city's love of quinto-quarto
                    (the butcher's "fifth quarter" of an animal, or offal)
                    cooking.

                    Zozzona isn't a dish that I grew up eating in Rome; in fact,
                    when I first posted a picture of an early in-development
                    iteration of this recipe to Instagram, a few of my Roman
                    friends sent me messages that amounted to, "Huh,
                    interesting, I've never had that but it sounds pretty
                    great." So how could this supposedly Roman pasta be such an
                    unknown to Romans? Well, it turns out that it's a dish from
                    the outskirts of town.

                    The Castelli Romani, referred to as just the Castelli
                    (castles) by Romans, is a historically agrarian area a few
                    miles southeast of Rome, in and around Lake Albano. It
                    comprises towns known for wine production (Frascati) and
                    pork (porchetta from Ariccia is the gold standard in the
                    Lazio region). Pasta alla zozzona is the kind of dish you
                    would find at a fraschetta, a no-frills tavern-style
                    establishment even more casual than an hostaria* or
                    trattoria, where kitchens turn out a handful of dishes to
                    pair with the local wine. The main ingredients of zozzona—

                    : a slice of bread spread with yogurt, mustard, and jam,
                    washed down with a glass of milk. He tries it and
                    immediately spits it out, exclaiming "Ammazza che zozzeria"
                    (jeez what a dirty mess), and then digs into a plate of
                    leftover pasta instead. Rigatoni alla zozzona is a dirty
                    mess, in the best possible way.
