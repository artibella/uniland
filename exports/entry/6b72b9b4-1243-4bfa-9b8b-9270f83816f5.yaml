                    . Let's add spaghetti puttanesca to the list. The modern,
                    classic Southern Italian pasta dish, flavored with garlic,
                    anchovies, capers, olives, and tomatoes, is one of my
                    favorite eat-it-by-myself meals—it's made 100% from pantry
                    staples, it packs a powerful flavor punch, and, let's be
                    honest, you probably don't want to hang out with someone
                    who's been eating anchovies and garlic, even if you've been
                    partaking of the same.

                    "Puttanesca" literally translates to "in the style of
                    prostitutes," supposedly because the pungent aromas of
                    garlic, anchovies, capers, and olives tossed with pasta were
                    how Neapolitan sex workers would lead customers to their
                    doors. This is one of those stories that seems, in the words
                    of Douglas Adams, apocryphal or at least wildly inaccurate.

                    : flavoring plenty of good extra-virgin olive oil by slowly
                    sizzling garlic and chili flakes in it. Puttanesca ups the
                    pungency factor a few notches by adding anchovies to that
                    mix. You can either thinly slice or finely chop the garlic,
                    depending on your mood—honestly, I use both ways equally
                    often—but the anchovies should be chopped quite finely so
                    that they dissolve into the oil as they cook.

                    Normally, I'm all for using the garlic press, the
                    Microplane, or the grater to mince garlic rapidly for dishes
                    in which it will be only briefly cooked with other
                    ingredients. But for a dish like this, for which you want to
                    really deeply flavor the oil from the get-go, garlic that is
                    pressed or grated ends up burning well before it can infuse
                    the oil.

                    —whole anchovies packed in salt are preferable. But for
                    applications in which the anchovies are going to be
                    dissolved, oil-packed fillets will do just fine. That's what
                    I use here.

                    Once the garlic and anchovies have had a bit of time to get
                    to know each other and the garlic starts to take on a slight
                    tan, in go the olives and capers. The tomatoes should go
                    into the pan immediately after. This will instantly stop the
                    garlic and anchovies from over-browning (you don't want them
                    to turn bitter). I use canned San Marzano tomatoes that I
                    break up by squeezing them between my fingers in a bowl,
                    resulting in a nice mix of purée and juicy chunks, then
                    bring the whole thing to a simmer.

                    Meanwhile, I get the spaghetti cooking, using a 12-inch
                    skillet or a sauté pan; there's no need to waste energy,
                    time, and water bringing a huge pot to a boil (especially in
                    water-strapped California). In fact, the dish comes out even
                    better with the low-water method of pasta cooking, as it
                    increases the concentration of starch in the water, which
                    will help the sauce thicken and cling to the noodles later
                    on.

                    One other thing you will want to do is make sure to add a
                    few spoonfuls of that starchy pasta cooking water in order
                    to help the sauce come together. When you first add the
                    spaghetti to the pan of sauce, it'll look loose and watery.
                    But simmer it hard for a moment while tossing, stirring, and
                    adding pasta water to keep it moist, and the sauce will
                    tighten right up, coating each strand of spaghetti in a thin
                    sheen of flavor.

A little bit of minced fresh parsley, some salt and pepper (go easy on the salt, since the other ingredients already add a ton), a final drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil for some fresh, grassy flavor, and our work is done.\_"

                    There's no need to stand on ceremony here. This is a quick
                    dish that tastes great served or eaten directly out of the
                    pan you cooked it in, but plates and extra grated cheese are
                    a nice touch.
