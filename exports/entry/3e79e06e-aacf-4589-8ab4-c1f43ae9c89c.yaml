                      The Swift Bird is a highly skilled flyer. It can fly at
                      speeds of up to 70 km/h and can even fly upside down and
                      backwards. The bird feeds on insects, which it catches
                      while flying. It can consume up to 2000 insects per day.
                      The bird's flying skills allow it to catch insects that
                      other birds cannot. The Swift Bird is also known for its
                      social behavior, as it lives in large colonies during the
                      breeding season.
