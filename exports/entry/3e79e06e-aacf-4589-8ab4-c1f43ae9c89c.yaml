                    Apus Apus has a distinctive appearance. It has a slender
                    body, long wings, and a forked tail. The bird is about 16cm
                    long, has a wingspan of about 42cm, and weighs about 45g.
                    The Swift Bird has a dark brown color, with a slightly paler
                    throat and a white belly. The bird's wings make up most of
                    its body length, making it look like a flying cigar. The
                    bird's wings are narrow and pointed, allowing it to fly at
                    high speeds and make sharp turns.

                    The Swift Bird is a highly skilled flyer. It can fly at
                    speeds of up to 70 km/h and can even fly upside down and
                    backwards. The bird feeds on insects, which it catches while
                    flying. It can consume up to 2000 insects per day. The
                    bird's flying skills allow it to catch insects that other
                    birds cannot. The Swift Bird is also known for its social
                    behavior, as it lives in large colonies during the breeding
                    season.
