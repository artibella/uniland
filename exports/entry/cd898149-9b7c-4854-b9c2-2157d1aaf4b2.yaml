                    As anyone familiar with marketing technology would agree,
                    change is constant. The footprint required of a typical
                    digital marketer—from mobile to social to SEO to customer
                    data and analytics—has been accelerating fast, let alone the
                    shift to SaaS and new approaches for front-end design and
                    performance.

However, such a reset often involves examining the company’s digital experience platform (DXP) and determining if that platform is keeping pace with the changes required, a step that especially holds true for those clients running Sitecore XM/XP. More on that later.'

                    Even though Sitecore XM/XP has been a mainstay of content
                    management at the mid-market and enterprise tiers for over a
                    decade, Sitecore is currently caught in the Martec’s Law
                    realities and in a world of major transition as the company
                    attempts to reset by overhauling its whole identity and
                    architecture. Instead of continuing as an on-prem DXP,
                    Sitecore has shifted portions of its architecture to be more
                    SaaS-like while paring back components that don’t perform
                    core-content management functions and replacing them with
                    acquisitions. Sitecore calls the resultant architecture
                    “Composable DXP,” but the reality for existing customers is
                    much more complicated.

                    Brands that are running the XM/XP legacy, which Sitecore
                    calls Platform DXP, are effectively running on an
                    architectural dead end. Since Sitecore has upgraded only
                    portions of the platform to ASP.NET core, you are limited in
                    how you deploy the solution, and your Sitecore team is
                    generally working with the older .Net framework, including
                    MVC.Also, Sitecore has moved several products to maintenance
                    mode without a path to newer offerings. Examples are
                    Experience Commerce and the Experience Database (xDB)
                    functionality of XP, which have been replaced by the Four51
                    and Boxever acquisitions. With no direct upgrade path,
                    customers are left starting from scratch. If forced to

                    On the technology side, Sitecore has, to its credit,
                    prepared for the future by acquiring SaaS vendors, including
                    Stylelabs for digital asset management (DAM) in 2018 and
                    four vendors in 2021: Boxever for customer data, Four51 for
                    commerce, Moosend for email, and Reflektion for search.As
                    for core content management, Sitecore has launched XM Cloud,
                    which brings a more SaaS-like experience. Content delivery
                    is replaced by cloud deployment and GraphQL, but without MVC
                    support. The content-management app offers more features,
                    enabling potentially faster initial setup even though still
                    based on the XM legacy system, including the need for local
                    developer instances and deployment for
                    customization.Nonetheless, Sitecore’s current offering is
                    complex and expensive—basically an aggregation of vendors
                    and technologies under the same company umbrella, but with
                    little cohesion. For what that actually means for customers,

                    Despite Sitecore’s efforts to segregate its customers into
                    two personas, legacy DXP and composable DXP, the real

                    organization, Uniform has published two informative guides
                    that explain how to derisk migration and modernize

                    However, Sitecore customers must ask additional questions of
                    themselves, such as if the new Sitecore offerings are
                    compelling enough in terms of cost or technology. After all,
                    if you do enjoy working with your agency partner, who’s tied
                    to Sitecore, it might make sense to continue doing that.
                    But, if you are not happy with Sitecore, you can either
                    continue with your current approach or choose one of two
                    converging paths, as described below.

                    One of the first questions organizations often ask
                    themselves is “Can we get away with doing nothing?” Nobody
                    wants to undertake a new, costly project that, at least in
                    the initial phases, just gets you out of the hole with
                    nothing new to show. So, a common choice is to put your head
                    in the sand and carry on with the XM/XP offering for as long
                    as feasible.However, that choice is unsustainable long term,
                    especially if you are relying on significant improvements or
                    new features. Eventually, the tech debt will be too big and
                    you’ll have to mount a drastic reset that might be driven by
                    factors outside your control, such as your development team
                    or agency losing talent on older technologies, such as .Net
                    framework or MVC, and platforms.In the long run, you’ll face
                    the fact that you have only two options of moving forward,
                    as follows.

                    As covered in Brinker’s Martec’s Law, it’s often easier to
                    spin out units or use cases and build from there, which is a
                    common entry point for working with composable vendors.Many
                    organizations start with a microsite or mobile app as a way
                    of testing new tools and approaches by adding content models
                    and use cases and varying the approaches for delivery. That
                    technique has a lot of appeal because it often means less
                    risk. A downside is that it’s slower. That’s where a digital
                    experience composition platform (DXCP) like Uniform can come
                    into play by not only enabling the approaches but also
                    rapidly connecting the underlying content and customer data
                    sources.

                    The first step is to refactor the front end, which is
                    usually what is holding you back the most. An example is
                    that the older platforms are on Java or .NET MVC while most
                    modern development is through React or other
                    JavaScript-based frameworks. The result is difficulty in
                    recruiting skilled developers, keeping dependencies
                    up-to-date, resolving security issues, and tackling the
                    end-of-life phase of underlying frameworks.With Uniform, you
                    work with generic front-end components, such as our example

                    , while mapping them to content sources, either legacy or

                    the back-end content sources any time without updating your
