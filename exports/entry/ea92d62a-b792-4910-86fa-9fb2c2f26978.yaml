                    Uniform’s visual editor — Canvas — is receiving some
                    exciting visual updates to improve hierarchy, navigation,
                    and support upcoming feature releases. We also think it just
                    looks a lot calmer and more pleasant to work with.

                    The header of Canvas has been re-arranged to make it clear
                    that switching releases will impact everything within the
                    editor. This also places in a similar location to where
                    you’ll find releases outside of Canvas.

                    The visual preview is really the star of our visual preview,
                    so with this refresh we’ve popped it out with some delicious
                    drop shadows and given it the visual prominence it deserves.

                    These changes to hierarchy also support upcoming features
                    for visual preview and an even more powerful localization
                    feature. Stay tuned!

                    The Canvas editor is no longer navigating into a cul-de-sac.
                    The familiar back button is still present (and you can still
                    use your browser’s back button), but now we have a nav menu.
                    To save you a few clicks, this single hamburger menu
                    provides direct access anywhere within the Experience
                    section of Uniform and top-level access to Optimization,
                    integrations, and settings.

                    This global header now also makes it clearer when what type
                    of object you’re working on. No longer will there be a pause
                    to ask: “is this a component pattern or a composition
                    pattern?” In fact, you’ll see these improvements for all
                    Canvas editors including composition defaults, workflows,
                    and entries.

                    We found that the “Attached to” field was a bit clumsy, so
                    this has now been split into a chip showing the current
                    project map path. Any dynamic inputs in the path will be
                    resolved using the current preview values.

                    Dynamic tokens that are available to use are listed
                    separately, alongside the current locale. This is because
                    dynamic tokens will soon include more than just project map
                    dynamic nodes and query strings! As before, clicking on any
                    chip will allow you to edit the preview values for all of
                    them.
