                      , I described a new way to bootstrap projects. To start
                      with, you run a project with composable systems that meet
                      stakeholder needs, followed by the headless tools and
                      services in play, and then bootstrap the project

                      An old African proverb says it well: “To go far, go with
                      people. To go fast, go alone.” Bootstrapping a project all
                      by yourself, quickly constructing something with the
                      Jamstack services and APIs already at your fingertips, is
                      an excellent weekend pastime. Businesses, however, must
                      think long-term and develop projects with all the teams in
                      mind for the purpose of building a digital experience that
                      meets different system and content needs.Toward that end,
                      bootstrap projects with composable systems to create
                      scalable websites and projects. For example, for a new
                      website with Jamstack as an architectural approach that
                      favors a microservices development pattern, consider the
                      project beyond code. Composability manages all the
                      services that interact with the front-end channel and
                      omnichannel routes by bringing together the various
                      services—the front end, the API, the commerce domain, the
                      commerce services that reside outside a client-facing
                      service or interface—and stitches interactions among
                      them.That model offers the most value to brands, which can
                      then add or remove services, or plug and play
                      technologies, as required, which is key to composability.
                      What’s more, the flexibility you gain, which supports
                      long-term success, does not impact the current flow of
                      your site throughout delivery channels.

                      In essence, digital experience composition serves as the
                      brain, through which you can plug in composable systems
                      and feed a single or standardized output to your front-end
                      presentation or channels.For example, an effective

The trick lies in how you compose the elements as well as orchestrate and package the tools, content, and systems. Ultimately, that’s the long-term, scalable plan for brands that leverage digital experience composition and a composable strategy.'
