          Ukrainian cuisine is the collection of the various cooking traditions
          of the people of Ukraine, one of the largest and most populous
          European countries. It is heavily influenced by the rich dark soil
          (chornozem) from which its ingredients come, and often involves many
          components.[1] Traditional Ukrainian dishes often experience a complex
          heating process â€“ "at first they are fried or boiled, and then stewed
          or baked. This is the most distinctive feature of Ukrainian
          cuisine".[2]
