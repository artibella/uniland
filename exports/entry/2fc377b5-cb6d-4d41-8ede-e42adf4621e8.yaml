                      Many brands still view the CMS as the cornerstone of their
                      digital experience stack, often overlooking the broader
                      capabilities required in today's multi-channel
                      environment. A standard headless CMS usually necessitates
                      extensive custom development to meet modern digital
                      experience needs.

                      Many brands still view the CMS as the cornerstone of their
                      digital experience stack, often overlooking the broader
                      capabilities required in today's multi-channel
                      environment. A standard headless CMS usually necessitates
                      extensive custom development to meet modern digital
                      experience needs.
