                      Monolithic, headless, MACH, composable, oh my! The past
                      couple of years have seen a resurgence of spending by
                      brands in digital-experience technologies. From the impact
                      of COVID to the uncertainty in markets, brands have been
                      seeking to raise the value of their digital properties,
                      specifically in agility, flexibility, and performance, and
                      overcome the slow time to market caused by the brands’
                      existing technologies. Plus, brands must pay attention to
                      retaining customers rather than just acquiring them.Many
                      are the approaches that take advantage of new
                      technologies. This article unpacks the options and their
                      relative strengths and weaknesses in building the
                      foundation on which you can scale or unchain your brand.As
                      a start, the following are the key terms that apply to
                      digital-experience architectures:

                      started before cloud and SaaS technology became standard
                      practice.Those vendors have large installed bases. Since
                      they might already have paid a premium for the
                      technologies, the existing customers usually stay around
                      for a few years. For other customers, it’s simply too hard
                      to change short-term because it took years to install
                      those systems with tentacles all over the place. Also,
                      those vendors have large, loyal agency partners and
                      systems integrators that have built their own service
                      offerings on top of the vendor's products, given that the
                      partners have abundant resources that are trained on the
                      technologies required for deployment and adoption. That’s
                      a common problem for less mature buyers, however: As
                      amazing as the vendor presentations and demos might look,
                      in reality, the architecture has long been outdated.
                      Obviously, smart brands would avoid those aging platforms
                      at all costs.

                      Suite vendors have often built or purchased various
                      products and integrated them themselves. Even though those
                      vendors have long been around, they have added modern
                      capabilities to their core platform since losing deals to
                      upstart competitors, such as headless vendors. These
                      additions include SDKs for modern JavaScript frameworks
                      (e.g., Next.js), headless capabilities, and easy
                      integration with their technology ecosystem. Suite vendors
                      tend to shy away from integrating outside their
                      suite.Since their platforms are typically not fully SaaS,

                    text: ' leverages MACH-certified technologies for CMS, commerce, DAM, etc., and then builds code for manual integration between the systems that offer the user experience, e.g., MACH technologies and their front end of choice—open architecture, API first, flexible business logic.The projects typically start with one or two connected systems, which can become complex to manage and maintain once the number of integrations exceeds five and the number of connection points, 20. The architecture is more composed—e.g., gluing the selected technologies together—than composable, which is easier to adapt on the go. This example can also be an agency-created accelerator.Also, since composed architectures are often developer led, only developers can update them. Consequently, those architectures tend to focus on engineering interfaces with little need for business user UX.'

                      The composable MACH architecture reaps the full benefits
                      of composable, e.g., flexibility in connecting
                      technologies to the stack and readiness in adapting to
                      future needs, such as new front-end frameworks, new
                      channels, and new markets.Organizations with a composable
                      MACH architecture aim for the highest level of
                      flexibility, optimized for the fastest time to market, and
                      for a great UX for the teams that manage digital
                      experiences. With a passion for maximum speed to market
                      and time to value and learn, those organizations can
                      iterate faster and faster.

                      Monolithic, headless, MACH, composable, oh my! The past
                      couple of years have seen a resurgence of spending by
                      brands in digital-experience technologies. From the impact
                      of COVID to the uncertainty in markets, brands have been
                      seeking to raise the value of their digital properties,
                      specifically in agility, flexibility, and performance, and
                      overcome the slow time to market caused by the brands’
                      existing technologies. Plus, brands must pay attention to
                      retaining customers rather than just acquiring them.Many
                      are the approaches that take advantage of new
                      technologies. This article unpacks the options and their
                      relative strengths and weaknesses in building the
                      foundation on which you can scale or unchain your brand.As
                      a start, the following are the key terms that apply to
                      digital-experience architectures:

                      , commerce, and digital asset management (DAM), having
                      started before cloud and SaaS technology became standard
                      practice.Those vendors have large installed bases. Since
                      they might already have paid a premium for the
                      technologies, the existing customers usually stay around
                      for a few years. For other customers, it’s simply too hard
                      to change short-term because it took years to install
                      those systems with tentacles all over the place. Also,
                      those vendors have large, loyal agency partners and
                      systems integrators that have built their own service
                      offerings on top of the vendor's products, given that the
                      partners have abundant resources that are trained on the
                      technologies required for deployment and adoption. That’s
                      a common problem for less mature buyers, however: As
                      amazing as the vendor presentations and demos might look,
                      in reality, the architecture has long been outdated.
                      Obviously, smart brands would avoid those aging platforms
                      at all costs.

                      Suite vendors have often built or purchased various
                      products and integrated them themselves. Even though those
                      vendors have long been around, they have added modern
                      capabilities to their core platform since losing deals to
                      upstart competitors, such as headless vendors. These
                      additions include SDKs for modern JavaScript frameworks
                      (e.g., Next.js), headless capabilities, and easy
                      integration with their technology ecosystem. Suite vendors
                      tend to shy away from integrating outside their
                      suite.Since their platforms are typically not fully SaaS,
                      suite vendors are

The architecture is more composed—e.g., gluing the selected technologies together—than composable, which is easier to adapt on the go. This example can also be an agency-created accelerator.Also, since composed architectures are often developer led, only developers can update them. Consequently, those architectures tend to focus on engineering interfaces with little need for business user UX.'
