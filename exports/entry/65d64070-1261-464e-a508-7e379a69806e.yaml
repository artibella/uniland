                    As brands expand where and how they sell online, single-page
                    editing tools pose big challenges for marketers and
                    merchandisers who manage high-volume sites. Dynamic Pages
                    solves this problem by enabling business users to adapt,
                    test, and iterate across thousands of webpages, all while
                    improving speed to market and offering greater control over
                    product-based experiences.

                        . Redirect Manager’s dashboard gives marketers and
                        merchandisers a complete view of redirects. By
                        validating each redirect, users minimize errors and
                        avoid duplication issues across pages. Moreover, your
                        teams’ redirects are portable across CDNs. So if you
                        need to redirect, you don’t need to rewrite a single
                        one.
