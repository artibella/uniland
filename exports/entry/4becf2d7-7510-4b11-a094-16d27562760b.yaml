                    Unlike "Italian" sausage commonly available in the States,
                    the salsiccia di Norcia used in pasta alla norcina isn't
                    seasoned with intensely aromatic fennel seeds or red pepper
                    flakes. It's a milder sausage, made with garlic, white wine,
                    salt, pepper, and, sometimes, a touch of grated nutmeg. It's
                    cool-weather sausage, not summer cookout links. Now, before
                    anyone gets worked up and turned off by the seemingly
                    daunting project of scratch-made sausage, hold on! We're not
                    asking you to spend days seasoning, grinding, and stuffing
                    meat into casings.

                    For this recipe, I settled on a shortcut method: you
                    aggressively mix store-bought ground pork with seasonings by
                    hand (or in a stand mixer if you prefer to bust out the
                    heavy machinery) to develop the myosin protein, which binds
                    the meat, giving sausage its characteristic tacky and sticky
                    texture. Pop the mix in the fridge for as little as an hour
                    and up to a couple of days to allow the seasonings to take
                    hold, and then you're cleared for pasta takeoff. If you
                    still aren't convinced about the payoff of scratch-made
                    sausage, this recipe will still work fine with store-bought
                    links, and I've provided instructions for using them as
                    well. I conducted side-by-side tests during recipe
                    development, and while I strongly prefer the homemade
                    sausage version, my tasting panel of one (my wife) enjoyed
                    both iterations.

You form the sausage mixture into patties (for easier flipping), brown them on one side in a skillet, flip them over, add chopped onion to the pan, break the sausage up into small pieces and cook until the onion is softened. Deglaze the pan with white wine, add cream, and then simmer it down to a saucy consistency. While that's happening, you cook pasta in boiling water until it's almost done, then add the noodles to the sauce along with a healthy splash of starchy pasta cooking water for a high-heat, glossy, saucy finish. Like other dairy-rich pastas with meaty morsels, you can make this dish with both dried, short, tubular pastas like penne or rigatoni, or with long, fresh,\_"

                    When the pasta comes off the heat, you shower it with
                    Pecorino Romano, freshly ground black pepper, and grated
                    nutmeg. It's meant to be a rich dish, and while it may be
                    tempting to sneak in some brightness with fresh herbs or a
                    splash of acidity, those ingredients would distract from and
                    dull the flavor of the sausage. And, of course, if you're in
                    a celebratory mood or you just happen to have them around
                    (good for you!), you can go all out with a black truffle
                    finishing move. But rest assured you'll be plenty satisfied
                    without them.
