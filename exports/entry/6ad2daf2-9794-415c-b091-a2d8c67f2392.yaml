                    for marketers and content creators lags far behind. Missing

                    technical teams. In the end, marketers are disempowered, and
                    developers are inundated with IT requests that divert time
                    away from strategic projects and innovations.Uniform DXCP is
                    built to accommodate the needs of all the teams that create

                    merchandising. By connecting content sources to a visual
                    workspace, marketing and content practioners can quickly

Even though composability is an underlying concept of MACH architecture, cobbling together headless tools into a composable stack doesn’t equal MACH. Moreover, those same tools might not be API-first or publicly accessible outside a vendor’s platform.Ultimately, MACH architecture must comprise well-articulated, defined microservices that can manage your platform’s entire infrastructure. With MACH-certified vendors like Uniform, you can plug and play MACH technologies and headless solutions into an agile, high-performance stack that avoids tech debt and the high cost of building and maintaining custom integration code.'

                    adopting a composable MACH architecture is the next step for

                    , Uniform guides brands in validating vendor technology and
                    the approach for building experiences and involving
                    stakeholders. Additionally, Uniform DXCP offers vendor
                    neutrality, enabling organizations to run a proof of concept
                    so as to test, learn, and decide which technologies deliver
                    the best consumer experience. As a result, digital
                    experience composition not only affords teams the freedom to
                    work with the tools they love, but also gives them
                    remarkable flexibility and scalability in doing their job.To
                    learn more about the future of digital experience and the
                    emergence of DXCPs, watch the full session below.
