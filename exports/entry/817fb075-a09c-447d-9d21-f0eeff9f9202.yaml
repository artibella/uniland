                    The beautiful thing about those two building blocks is that
                    not only are they essential components of so many other
                    sauces, but they also make one of the greatest pasta sauces
                    all on their own. Aglio e olio, I think it's safe to claim,
                    is the simplest pantry-staples-only pasta sauce in the
                    entire Italian canon. You don't even need cheese—in fact,
                    some would argue cheese isn't a welcome addition. If you
                    have spaghetti, garlic, salt, and oil, you can make this
                    pasta right now.

                    Given its ease, you'd think aglio e olio would be a much
                    more widely known pasta sauce. In Italy, it is. Most
                    Italians I've met get misty-eyed when they speak of it,
                    recalling childhoods full of after-school bowls of aglio e
                    olio whipped up by their beloved mammas. In the United
                    States, though, it's not on most people's radar, despite
                    this country's deep pasta obsession—which is a shame.

                    Making it couldn't be easier, though it still requires
                    attention to the basic method for finishing almost any pasta
                    dish. It starts by gently cooking garlic in a skillet with
                    olive oil until it's very lightly golden. I often add a
                    pinch of red pepper flakes, which technically makes the dish
                    aglio, olio, e peperoncino. They add a pleasant, warm heat
                    without overcomplicating the basic garlic-and-oil flavor.

                    While the garlic quietly sizzles, the pasta should be
                    boiling away in a separate pot of salted water. (

                    , which is 3% salinity; 1%, or roughly one tablespoon per
                    quart or liter of water, is about all you want.) You need
                    only enough water to sufficiently cover the pasta and give
                    it some room to move around. That can mean a large pot with
                    the pasta dropped in vertically, or a wide, large skillet
                    with the pasta on its side.

                    As soon as the pasta is just shy of al dente, transfer it to
                    the skillet with the garlic and oil. Then add a few
                    tablespoons of the pasta water and cook it all together over
                    high heat, stirring and tossing rapidly, to emulsify the oil
                    with the starchy pasta water.

                    It's ready when the sauce reduces to a creamy coating on the
                    noodles. If you over-reduce it and the sauce becomes too
                    oily, you can always add a little more pasta water to get it
                    back where you want it. A drizzle of fresh olive oil
                    reintroduces its uncooked, fruity flavor.

                    If you're dead set on adding grated cheese, this would be
                    the time to do it, though I'd encourage at least trying it
                    without first. I'll sometimes add a little minced parsley if
                    I have some on hand, but even that is optional.
