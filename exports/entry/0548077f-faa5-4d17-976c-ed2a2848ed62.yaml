          m Jahr 2023 stehen CMOs vor Herausforderungen, da sich das Marketing
          auf digitale Kanäle verlagert und Wettbewerber Zugang zu denselben
          Tools erhalten. Veraltete Marketingtechnologie behindert die
          Kundenbindung. Die gute Nachricht ist, dass ein kompatibler Ansatz
          diese Probleme ohne kostspielige Replatforming-Maßnahmen lösen kann.
