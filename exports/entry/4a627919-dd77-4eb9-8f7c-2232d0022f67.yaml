                    You don’t have to let your pizza dough rise overnight – or
                    up to 48 hours – in the refrigerator, but if you do, it will
                    develop more flavor and air bubbles that will puff up when
                    the pizza is cooked. (Some people fight over the slices with
                    air bubbles.) Make sure to take the dough out of the
                    refrigerator an hour before using it to bring it to room
                    temperature.

                    There are some toppings that should be cooked first before
                    topping a pizza because they won’t cook fully before the
                    pizza is done cooking. Raw meat should be fully cooked
                    before adding it as a topping. Any vegetables that you don’t
                    want to be raw on the cooked pizza such as onions, peppers,
                    broccoli, or mushrooms should be sautéed first.

                    After the pizza dough has risen, you can freeze it to use
                    later. Divide the dough in half (or the portion sizes you
                    will be using to make your pizzas). Place on parchment paper
                    or a lightly floured dish and place, uncovered, in the
                    freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the freezer and
                    place in individual freezer bags, removing as much air as
                    you can from the bags. Return to the freezer and store for
                    up to 3 months.

                    Thaw the pizza dough in the refrigerator overnight or for 5
                    to 6 hours. Then let the dough sit at room temperature for
                    30 minutes before stretching it out in the next steps.

                                      At this point you can choose how long you
                                      want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow
                                      fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will
                                      result in more complex flavors in the
                                      dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours
                                      in a warm place) will allow the dough to
                                      rise sufficiently to work with.
