                      DXPs had great success by building tools that enabled
                      business teams to build personalized digital experiences.
                      However, for developers, those platforms were a time sink,
                      forcing them to become experts in proprietary technologies
                      and constraining their ability to innovate.Despite their
                      modernization efforts, DXP vendors failed to adapt to
                      market changes as headless-technology vendors emerged with
                      a different vision of how digital experiences should be
                      built and who should control the process.

                      Headless technologies went in the opposite direction: open
                      APIs and outstanding tools for developers but a nightmare
                      for business users. Suddenly, marketers and merchandisers
                      had to jump between tools and request developer support
                      for even routine tasks. All too often, marketers’ requests
                      were trapped in the developer backlog.Still, the
                      significant gains offered by headless made the trade-offs
                      worthwhile. Brands could deliver experience at such high
                      speed that their SEO ranking soared. Not only did more
                      conversions result, but brands also became more agile,
                      capable of responding quickly to changing business needs.

                      Headless led to composable, whereby brands build a stack
                      based on their needs instead of buying a bloated DXP
                      suite. In response, vendors in the monolithic DXP and
                      headless arenas called themselves composable almost
                      overnight.The theory makes a lot of sense but, In
                      practice, composable is very difficult to do well. Many
                      brands are stuck with tools that are connected by endless
                      custom glue code that’s slow to build and expensive to
                      maintain. Some organizations have tried to overcome those
                      issues with agency accelerators, but in reality that just
                      means they’re stuck in the agency’s glue rather than their
                      own. Even though that might speed up short-term delivery,
                      the long-term lock-in issue still exists and is
                      potentially even worse. As I like to say, “Composable
                      tools don’t compose themselves.” Both DXP and headless
                      encompass three serious issues:

                      In today’s hypercompetitive market, brands can’t afford to
                      spend time on workarounds, and of course they don’t want
                      experts to quit because they’re sick of using tools they
                      hate.Business teams and development teams end up in
                      conflict with each other, competing for tools that work
                      for one but not the other. This is the reality in the
                      industry, as we see any time we talk about a purchasing
                      process is either “marketing-led” or “developer-led.”

                      For the business to thrive, both business and developer
                      teams must be empowered. That was what we set out to do
                      when we founded Uniform.[![DXC ebook Banner

                      In a composed solution, the composable API orchestration
                      and front-end layer are connected by glue code, removing
                      so much of the flexibility and ability to innovate that
                      makes a tangible difference to business outcomes. This
                      problem is even worse in large, complex stacks, where the
                      number of integrations between tools gets exponential.With
                      digital experience composition's no-code orchestration
                      layer, your marketers and other business users can compose
                      digital experiences based on your design system, your
                      underlying technologies, and the content business teams
                      create—without involving developers at all.publishedWhat
                      is digital experience composition?Together, those layers
                      are where business teams and developers intersect.
                      Developers can add components in the top layer and map
                      them to sources from the bottom layer. Business teams are
                      free to use those components for any experience. The
                      result is lightning-fast compositions for any channel in
                      the context of the visitors’ in-the-moment intent.Uniform
                      digital experience composition platform (DXCP) makes that
                      vision a reality. It’s so easy to adapt your stack to meet
                      changing business needs that it doesn’t go stale. In fact,
                      as you build a more sustainable platform, your stack’s
                      value rises as you can easily incorporate new technologies
                      to take advantage of innovations and learnings faster than
                      your competitors.

                      At its initial release, Uniform Canvas functioned as a

                      to easily create and manage compositions: pages, emails,
                      apps. It had the convenience of a page-builder, but with
